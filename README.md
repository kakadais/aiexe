## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have `npm` and Python installed on your system.

## Installation

### CLI Installation

#### Windows CLI Installation
1. Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
2. Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
3. Run PowerShell and execute the following command to set the execution policy:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force
   ```
   This command allows scripts signed by a trusted publisher to be run and avoids interruptions during the installation of `aiexe`. Be cautious with this setting, as it can potentially expose your system to security risks if scripts from untrusted sources are executed.
4. Install `aiexe` globally using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install aiexe -g
   ```
5. Start using `aiexe` by entering the command:
   ```bash
   aiexe
   ```

#### macOS CLI Installation
1. Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
2. Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
3. Install `aiexe` globally using npm:
   ```bash
   sudo npm install aiexe -g
   ```
4. Start using `aiexe` by entering the command:
   ```bash
   aiexe
   ```

#### Linux CLI Installation
1. Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
2. Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
3. Install `aiexe` globally using npm:
   ```bash
   sudo npm install aiexe -g
   ```
4. Start using `aiexe` by entering the command:
   ```bash
   aiexe
   ```

### GUI Installation

#### Windows GUI Installation
1. Open PowerShell with administrative privileges and run the following command:
   ```powershell
   if (Get-Command npm -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) { $timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMddHHmmss"; $folderName = "_aiexe_project_$timestamp"; $desktopPath = [System.IO.Path]::Combine([System.Environment]::GetFolderPath('Desktop'), $folderName); New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $desktopPath -Force; if (Test-Path $desktopPath) { Set-Location -Path $desktopPath; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/kakadais/aiexe/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" -OutFile "__aiexe_project__.zip" -ErrorAction Stop; if (Test-Path "__aiexe_project__.zip") { Expand-Archive -Path "__aiexe_project__.zip" -DestinationPath "."; Set-Location -Path "aiexe-main"; npm i; if ($?) { npm run build; if ($?) { ii "dist"; ii "dist\\aiexe Setup*.exe" } } } } } else { Write-Output "npm is not installed. Please download and install it from https://nodejs.org." }
   ```

#### macOS GUI Installation
1. Open Terminal and run the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R 501:20 ~/.npm 2>/dev/null; command -v npm >/dev/null 2>&1 && { timestamp=$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S) && cd ~/Downloads && mkdir "_aiexe_project_$timestamp" && cd "_aiexe_project_$timestamp" && git clone https://github.com/kakadais/aiexe && cd aiexe && npm i && npm run build && open dist/aiexe-*.dmg; } || { echo "npm is not installed. Please download and install it from https://nodejs.org."; }
   ```

## Usage

`aiexe` can be used with various options. The basic usage is as follows:

```bash
aiexe [options] [prompt]
```

- `prompt`: Enter the prompt for the task to execute.

### Options

- `-V, --version`: Output the version number of `aiexe`.
- `-r, --resetconfig`: Reset the configuration and Python virtual environment to their initial state.
- `-s, --source <source>`: Specify the source language. The default is "auto".
- `-d, --destination <destination>`: Specify the destination language. The default is an empty string ("").
- `-c, --choosevendor`: Choose the LLM vendor.
- `-m, --choosemodel`: Choose the LLM model.
- `-p, --python <command>`: Run a command in the Python virtual environment.
- `-h, --help`: Display help information.

### Examples

1. Execute a task with a prompt:
   ```bash
   aiexe "Convert all jpg files in the /Users/kst/Downloads/data folder to black and white and place them in the /Users/kst/Downloads/data/grayscalephoto folder. If the folder does not exist, make it."
   ```

2. Choose the LLM vendor:
   ```bash
   aiexe -c
   ```

3. Choose the LLM model:
   ```bash
   aiexe -m
   ```

4. Run a command in the Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   aiexe -p "pip install numpy pandas"
   ```
   Or
   ```bash
   aiexe -p "pip install -r requirements.txt"
   ```

## Translation Feature

`aiexe` provides a translation feature that allows you to translate prompts into different languages. To use the translation feature, specify the source language with the optional `-s` option and the destination language with the required `-d` option. The language specification uses ISO 639-1 language codes.

### ISO 639-1 Language Codes

ISO 639-1 is an international standard for representing languages with two-letter codes, established by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

For example:
- en: English
- fr: French
- ko: Korean
- ja: Japanese
- vi: Vietnamese
- es: Spanish
- de: German
- zh: Chinese
- ru: Russian
- it: Italian
- pt: Portuguese
- hi: Hindi

### Options

- `-s, --source <source>` (Optional): Specify the source language. The default is "auto", which automatically detects the source language. To specify a specific language, use its ISO 639-1 code.
- `-d, --destination <destination>` (Required): Specify the destination language using its ISO 639-1 code.

### Usage Examples

1. Translate from English to Korean:
   ```bash
   aiexe -s en -d ko "Run a command in the Python virtual environment"
   ```
   This command translates "Run a command in the Python virtual environment" to Korean.

2. Translate from Korean to English using automatic language detection:
   ```bash
   aiexe -d en "파이썬 가상 환경에서 명령어 실행하기"
   ```
   This command translates "파이썬 가상 환경에서 명령어 실행하기" to English. Since the `-s` option is not specified, it automatically detects the source language as Korean.

3. Translate using a pipeline:
   ```bash
   echo "Run a command in the Python virtual environment" | aiexe -s en -d ko
   ```
   This command passes "Run a command in the Python virtual environment" through a pipeline to `aiexe` and translates it to Korean.

The translation feature makes it more convenient to use `aiexe` in multilingual environments. Specify the appropriate source and destination languages or use a pipeline to translate prompts as needed.

## Safety Features

To ensure that generated code does not negatively impact your system or external environment, `aiexe` requires manual confirmation from the user before executing any commands. This feature enhances security by allowing you to evaluate and approve commands before they are run. Please be cautious and make sure you understand the purpose and implications of any AI-generated code before you use it.

**Disclaimer**: The user assumes full responsibility for the use of `aiexe`. Ensure that you operate in a safe environment and carefully consider the intent and consequences of the code you execute.

## Additional Python Environment Setup

When using `aiexe` to generate Python code, you might require additional Python packages to fully execute the generated scripts. To facilitate this, `aiexe` allows you to pre-install necessary Python packages into its virtual environment.

You can install individual packages using the command:
```bash
aiexe -p "pip install numpy pandas"
```

Alternatively, if you have a `requirements.txt` file that lists all of the necessary packages, you can install all of them at once with:
```bash
aiexe -p "pip install -r requirements.txt"
```

This feature ensures that all dependencies are resolved before executing any AI-generated Python code, providing a smoother and more efficient workflow.
